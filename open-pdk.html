	<p>Tim ‘mithro’ Ansell is a software engineer at Google and has been developing open source software for 20+ years. </p>
	<p>Tim has recently started trying to shake things up in the hardware accelerator development ecosystem by removing roadblocks to having a completely open ecosystem.</p>
	<p>In 2020 he worked with SkyWater Foundry, a domestic U.S. manufacturer of integrated circuits, to release the world’s first fully open source, manufacturable PDK for their 130nm process node and is funding a free shuttle program for open source designs.</p>
	<p>He has also contributed to projects in the open EDA ecosystem like OpenROAD, OpenRAM, Magic and many others.</p>
