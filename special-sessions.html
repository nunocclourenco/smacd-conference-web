	<h2> TUTORIALS </h2>
	<p >
	Tutorials allow participants to explore innovative trends and learn new techniques from experts on specific topics. SMACD solicits proposals for tutorials of 90 minutes. Tutorial proposers should  provide the following information:
	<ul>
		<li>Title of the Tutorial;</li>
		<li>Brief description (approx. 100 words);</li>
		<li>Short bio of the organizer;</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
		
	<h2> SPECIAL SESSIONS</h2>
	<p >Special sessions (SS) provide the opportunity to focus in detail on emerging topics that are not reflected in the list of conference tracks or represent a specific working field where researchers would like to meet and discuss advances. </p>
	<p >SS proposers should provide, the SS & Tutorials chairs, the following information:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Title of the Special Session;</li>
	<li>Brief description of the area of concern (approx. 100 words), with a particular focus on why this is an exciting and significant topic;</li>
	<li>The name, short bio and contact information of 1 or 2 session chairs willing to promote and organize the special session; </li>
	<li>A list of at least 5 potential papers with authors, affiliations and tentative paper titles.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Accepted papers for the special sessions will be included in the conference proceedings and published in IEEExplorer.</p>

		<h2 class="featurette-heading"  <a name = "WPT"></a> Wireless Power Transfer Systems:<br> Enhanced modeling, Simulation and Design</h2>
		<p class="intro" >In the last decade, the growing number of personal electronic devices that people rely on in daily life has created a large demand for Wireless Power Transfer (WPT). The development and commercialization of this technology for consumer applications have also opened opportunities in several markets, such as wearable electronics, RF energy harvesters, health-care and automotive industry. </p>	
		<p class="intro">WPT-charging for consumer electronics (e.g.,
smartphones, smartwatches, etc.) is increasingly
impacting our life. Extreme flexibility, lowcost
and good tolerance to devices misalignment
are mandatory features for these systems.
WPT-chargeable medical implants (e.g., pacemakers,
hearing aids, etc.) are considered as
the best alternative to conventional implantable
devices, by eliminating any complication
due to leads and batteries, but they are subject
to tight safety, size and ultra-low power consumption
constraints. WPT-charging for electric
vehicles batteries is also an important step
towards a new model of sustainable transport.
Several solutions are already available on the
market for electric vehicles static charging, but
dynamic WPT-charging still requires more insights
before it can be effectively adopted.</p>
		
		<p class="intro"> Whatever the application, investigating the relationships
			between the main properties of circuit
			architectures, power devices, coils and control
			strategies and the efficiency of the energytransfer
			between the source and the load of the
			WPT-charging systems is of primary importance.
			Suitable models and methods are needed to accomplish
			such challenging tasks, considering
			also the impact of uncertainties and tolerances.
			This Special Session aims to gather original contributions
			on enhanced modeling, simulation,
			design and testing of WPT-charging systems. </p>

		<h2 class="featurette-heading"><a name = "DeepLearning"></a> MACHINE LEARNING FOR MIXED-SIGNAL EDA:<br/>
ENABLING DESIGN ENGINEERS WITH LEARNING TOOLS AND ALGORITHMS</h2>
		<p class="intro" >Machine Learning (ML) is very hot topic nowadays
					showing the ability to distill knowledge
					from existing data, create models or even generate
					new variants.</p>
		<p class="intro">Such techniques can help engineers during the
					design process of many applications that drive
					the microelectronics industry. These techniques
					are more and more used on all levels of electronic
					designs.</p>
		<p class="intro">This Special Session aims to bring together original
					research that advances analog and mixedsignal
					EDA using machine learning methods for
					broad applications such as device modeling,
					circuit sizing, circuit layout, system-level synthesis
					and others.</p>
