	<div class="col-md-8">
		<p class="intro" >Xyce is an open source, highly accurate, and massively parallel SPICE circuit simulator developed at Sandia National Laboratories. The Xyce Python Model Interpreter (Xyce-PyMi), also developed at Sandia, enables the execution of devices with behavior defined in Python as part of a larger circuit simulation using Xyce. This allows the circuit designers to rapidly generate models from data and to evaluate circuit performances in a production circuit simulator, leading to a robust and higher confidence design.</p>
		<p>	In this tutorial, starting with an introduction to Xyce, the audience will be guided through installation of Xyce-PyMi, development of an electrical device defined in Python, and will be given resources for use in developing more complicated data-driven device models using Python packages such as TensorFlow.</p>

	<h3 >Emerging Technologies and Computing Paradigms for Edge Computing applications</h3>
	<h2 class="pt_plenary"><small> Organizer:</small><br><u>Juan Nuñez</u></h2>
	<h3 class="pt_plenary-presenter">Instituto de Microeletrónica de Sevilla, ES</h3>

		<p class="intro" >
			Edge Computing applications require platforms to extract task-relevant information from increasingly large amounts of data with stringent constraints on energy efficiency, performance, cost, and reliability. Traditionally, silicon CMOS scaling has been relied upon to meet these energy and delay constraints. However, the energy and delay benefits achievable via scaling are diminishing. Therefore, there is an urge to explore new energy efficient devices and interconnects as the building blocks for energy efficient systems. This special session aims to bring together contributions focusing on different topics related to the modelling, design of circuits and systems using emerging technologies, as well as to highlight the latest advances in novel computing paradigms.

	<h3>Today's future electronic circuits and systems with emerging memory devices</h3>
	<h2 class="pt_plenary"><small> Organizer:</small><br><u>Vasileios Ntinas</u></h2>
	<h3 class="pt_plenary-presenter">Technische Universität Dresden, DE</h3>

	<div class="col-md-8">
		<p class="intro" >
Today's computer systems are on the verge of a paradigm shift from general-purpose architectures to cutting-edge specialized technologies optimized for particular computational workloads. This trend is driven by the increased need for autonomous, high-performance systems that can sense and process remotely on a tiny energy budget and footprint. Emerging memory technologies are increasingly growing since they provide novel nanoelectronic devices with outstanding features for single electronic components, including non-volatility, adaptability, low-power operation, and ultra-dense integration. Their operating principles arise from various physical mechanisms, based on their nanoelectronic structure, leading to a wide range of device types, ranging from ionic, and crystallographic (ReRAM, CBRAM, PCM) to magnetic, and ferroelectric devices (MRAM, FTJ, FeFET). Even though the original target of such technologies is memory, they demonstrate suitability for a wide range of novel computing and bio-inspired applications. However, the readiness of these technologies is yet far from large-scale commercialization and they are still facing fundamental issues in modeling, simulation, and circuit design. The main goal of this special session is to bring high-quality research on emerging technologies into SMACD ’23 and to create a forum for fruitful knowledge transfer between the traditional SMACD audience and researchers working on novel computing approaches that utilize emerging devices. 
		</p>
		<p>The topics of this special session focus on:</p>
<li>Physical and numerical emerging memory device modeling</li>
<li>Circuit design techniques for In-Memory Computing with emerging technologies</li>
<li>CMOS integration of emerging technologies</li>
<li>Variability- and reliability-aware design of emerging device-based circuits</li>
<li>Emerging devices for bio-inspired circuits and systems</li>
			</ul>
