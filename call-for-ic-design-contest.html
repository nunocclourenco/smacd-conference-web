<h2> HOW TO ENTER THE COMPETITION? </h2>
<p>

All participants must submit a paper (following <b>SMACD 2023 submission guidelines</b>) that fits into one or more of the following categories:
<ol>
	<li>Novel IC designs whose performances compete within the state-of-the-art of its research field (at least including Post-Layout simulations);</li>

	<li>ICs designs where at least one step of its development flow was partially (or fully) assisted by custom/academic Computer-Aided Design and/or Electronic Design Automation tools;</li>

	<li>IC designs clearly identifying one or more steps of the development flow that would greatly benefit from the development of new Computer-Aided Design and/or Electronic Design Automation tools.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p class="intro alternative-color"> <b >The layout of the circuit must be present and a prototype test is considered an added value. The first author of the submission and presenter at the conference must be a MSc or a PhD student!</b></p>

<h2> Important Notes</h2>

<ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
<li>All accepted submissions in the IC Design Contest will be <b>presented by the students in special sessions and published in the conference proceedings</b>.</li>
<li>Papers not accepted for the contest short-list <b>will</b> still <b>be considered</b> by the technical program committee <b>for the SMACD 023 regular sessions</b>.</li></ul>

		<h2> Topics of Interest </h2>
		<p>IC designs resulting or enhanced by EDA methodologies and tools related
			to all aplication topics of the SMACD23, e.g., AMS, RF and multidomain
			circuits, and, also, emerging devices.

		<h2 >Evaluation Criteria</h2>
		<p>A Judging Committee will select the winner(s) based on the quality of the
			paper, the presentation at the conference and the Q&A during the
			special session, using the following criteria:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><b class="alternative-color">Complexity</b> of the problem posed in the paper.</li>
		<li><b class="alternative-color">Level of EDA support</b> to reach the presented IC design.</li>
		<li><b class="alternative-color">Robustness</b> of the design solutions (e.g., against parasitics, variability, etc.).</li>
		</ul>



		

• Level of EDA support to reach the presented IC design, at least one of
the topics below should have been part of the IC design process, e.g.:

• Robustness of the design solution (e.g., against parasitics, variability,
reliability, etc.)
