<p class="center intro"> For the first time in <b class="alternative-color">SMACD Conferences</b>, the <b class="alternative-color">2023 edition</b>, which will take place at Madeira Island from the 3rd to the 5th of July,<br> will also hold a thrilling and dynamic event where M.Sc. and Ph.D. students can compete with their best use of EDA <br> methodologies, to reach one unique yet challenging goal:</p>


<p class="center bold intro base-color">“ENHANCE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS DESIGN”</p></div></div>

<div class="row ">
<div class="col-md-7">
<h2> HOW TO ENTER THE COMPETITION? </h2>
<p>

All participants must submit a paper (following the same SMACD 2023
submission guidelines) with a description on how the use of EDA
methodologIes were used to reach the IC design solution and on how
decisive on pushing performance beyond the state-of-the-art. The layout
of the circuit must be present and a prototype test is considered as an
added value.
</p>
<p class="intro alternative-color"> <b >The first author of the submission and presenter at the conference must be a MSc or a PhD student!</b></p>

<h2> Important Notes</h2>

<ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
<li>All accepted submissions in the IC Design Contest will be <b>presented by the students in special sessions and published in the conference proceedings</b>.</li>
<li>Papers not accepted for the contest short-list <b>will</b> still <b>be considered</b> by the technical program committee <b>for the SMACD 023 regular sessions</b>.</li></ul>

		<ul>
		<li><b class="alternative-color">Complexity</b> of the problem posed in the paper.</li>
		<li><b class="alternative-color">Level of EDA support</b> to reach the presented IC design, at least one of
			the topics below should have been part of the IC design process, e.g.:
			<ul>
				<li>system-level sizing and optimization</li>
				<li>circuit-level sizing and optimization</li>
				<li>layout-aware sizing and optimization</li>
				<li>placement generation</li>
				<li>routing generation</li>
				<li>layout optimization</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b class="alternative-color">Robustness</b> of the design solutions (e.g., against parasitics, variability, etc.).</li>
		</ul>



		

• Level of EDA support to reach the presented IC design, at least one of
the topics below should have been part of the IC design process, e.g.:

• Robustness of the design solution (e.g., against parasitics, variability,
reliability, etc.)
