The DDSM can contribute significantly on the phase noise and spur pattern in the output of a nonlinear synthesizer. A type of time-varying spurs and another type of fixed sub-fractional frequency spurs, denoted wandering spurs and horn spurs, respectively, have been observed in simulations and measurements of fractional-N frequency synthesizers with a MASH-based divider controller. Different families of DDSMs have been presented in the past which represent an alternative to MASH-DDSMs. Among those, the ENOP DDSMs are worthy of notice because of their performance in terms of nonlinearity-induced noise and spurs. In this work we show that ENOP-based divider controllers offer strong mitigation of both wandering and horn spurs.</p></td></tr>

At this frequency, an underlying asymmetrical layout of the switching quad leads to several problems such as output amplitude difference, phase difference deviating from 180°, and conversion gain (CG) degradation. An imbalance analysis is therefore carried out to understand the critical layout routings. The results show that the imbalance at the collectors of the transistors has the most severe impact on the differential output amplitudes and phases. On the other hand, imbalance at the base influences the CG mostly. Based on these findings, a frequency doubler was designed in the SiGe SG13G2 technology. The proposed frequency doubler achieves a maximum output power of -5.8 dBm and a 1-dB bandwidth of 25 GHz from 202.5 GHz to 227.5 GHz with 91 mW of dc power consumption in the full EM post layout simulation.</p></td></tr>

Two gyrator-based second-order gm-C structures are used to achieve an overall low-pass filtering order of at least 4. Fully differential operational transconductance amplifiers (OTA) with capacitive source degeneration and capacitive load result in a band-pass frequency response. This way, the down-converted signal is filtered and DC offsets from previous stages are suppressed. By adding two programmable gain amplifiers (PGA) that show first-order low-pass behavior as well, the whole structure also acts as a gain stage and the filtering is slightly improved. The band-pass filters and PGAs are arranged in an alternating fashion in order to prevent possible DC offsets from propagating through the chain. Every stage features a common-mode feedback (CMFB) loop. The nominal filter bandwidth is from 150kHz to 2MHz and the upper band edge can be varied between 1.5MHz and 4.5MHz. The overall gain is adjustable between 0dB and 42dB and the whole structure only needs 25µA at 900mV supply voltage. The filter is implemented in a 28nm CMOS technology. The design was verified by post-layout simulations.</p></td></tr>

By introducing a distributed amplitude detection scheme, the proposed ACL implementation can regulate B1 field intensities in injection-locked VCO arrays with reduced loading effects and minimal phase noise degradation. Extracted-level circuit simulations on an example VCO array implementation demonstrate the functionality and excellent achievable performance of the proposed approach.</p></td></tr>

Redundancy-based methods are widely used against Single Event Upsets, causing significant temporal and spatial overhead. The traditional method to evaluate the reliability of a system is fault injection. However, it is practically impossible to test all faults for a complex design due to intractable simulation times. In this paper, we propose using formal methods to evaluate hardware reliability in the presence of soft errors. The proposed method can exhaustively search the entire state space and the whole fault list in a reasonable time. The method is applied to assess the vulnerability of all registers in a RISC-V Ibex core.</p></td></tr>

However, as the complexity of analog design cases tackled by these methodologies increases, a broader set of topological constraints must be supported to cover different layout styles and circuit classes. Here, model-independent differentiable encodings for regularity, boundary, and symmetry island (SI) constraints are described, and an unsupervised loss function is used for the artificial neural network (ANN) model to learn how to generate placements that follow them. As only sizing data is required for its training, it discards the need to acquire legacy layouts containing insights of these types of constraints. The model is ultimately used to produce floorplans from scratch, at push-button speed, for state-of-the-art analog structures, including technology nodes not used for its training.</p></td></tr>

Therefore, worst-case estimates are usually applied which results in overdesign and, thus, waste of area and power consumption. Moreover, simulation of almost final designs is extremely computational expensive usually avoiding iteration loops. In order to enable both early performance estimates and fast iteration runs, we combined parasitic layout estimation through templates in generators with SystemC-based parameterizable modelling. As the result, we can run layout-aware performance estimates of a capacitive pipeline ADC within a runtime of only about one minute per iteration. Using this estimation in a loop, we analyzed and optimized the generator parameters of a capacitor array in order to improve the ADC’s performance.</p></td></tr>

In analog layout design, the parasitics induced by interconnecting wires and elements affect the accuracy and performance of the device. Due to the requirement of low-power and high-speed, the series of lateral metal-metal very small capacitor units as the architecture of capacitor array is usually adopted. Besides power consumption and area reduction, the parasitic capacitance would significantly affect the matching properties and setting time of capacitors. This work presents a framework to synthesize good-quality binary-weighted capacitors for custom advanced node planar SAR ADC. Also, this work proposed a parasitic-aware ILP-based routing algorithm, which can generate an optimized layout considering parasitic capacitance and capacitance ratio mismatch simultaneously. The experimental result shows that the effective number of bits (ENOB) of the layout generated by our approach is comparable with manual design and other automated works.</p></td></tr>

The second technique, named Auto-Sensitivity (AS) technique, reduces the photon-detection probability (PDP) if a certain background illumination level is detected, to avoid the risk of saturating SPADs due to intense background level. The two methods are first compared to each other, showing that the photon coincidence technique outperforms the AS technique.

Recently, semiconductor quantum dots have demonstrated great potential as luminescent probes for trace explosive detection. However, the growing interest in this technology and its potentiality is not accompanied by its widespread use in practical applications and in operating environments since most of the proposed devices still consist of lab-based procedures not amenable for field operation. This work explores and compares two alternative ways of employing quantum dots as sensing material to build simple, compact, and reusable devices for vapor explosive detection, beyond their typical use as fluorescent probes in solution. First, a high-performance chemiresistive sensor whose electrical resistance changes proportionally to the target gas concentration is proposed. Then, we present an optical system based on the solid-state photoluminescence of quantum dots cast on a silicon substrate. Easy fabrication, portability, low-cost, high sensitivity, and reusability make both the reported devices quite promising not only for laboratory-scale testing but also for practical applications on the field.</p></td></tr>

However, optimizations considering process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) corners or layout still pose unprecedented challenges in applying these tools due to the high simulation times and different simulator convergence issues. This paper proposes two different deep learning (DL) models to assist the PVT-inclusive simulation-based sizing process of RF ICs, and more specifically, voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs). Given specific devices’ dimensions, the 1st model classifies the likeability of the circuit to convergence for nominal and PVT corners, bypassing solutions that will hardly procedure valuable information for the optimization process, while the 2nd model predicts the VCOs’ oscillating frequencies for the aforementioned conditions. The methodology is tested on a state-of-the-art VCO, reducing 19% of the workload of the circuit simulator, ultimately saving almost 5 days of computational effort and with improvement on the optimization result.</p></td></tr>

To ensure a high yield, design engineers are considering certain manufacturing limits of the devices. Estimation of the yield is not a trivial process as it is influenced by multiple design parameters therefore a detailed modeling of the device and high precision simulation is required. A large amount of simulation is required for this task and performing this analysis on a family of devices results in running thousands of simulations which is a very time consuming process (e.g a single finite element simulation may take tens of minutes). In this paper we propose a yield estimation method based on 3D finite element simulations. The proposed method consists of developing a prediction meta model, which has as inputs the design properties (geometry and material) of a power transistor and estimates On-State Resistance (Ron) of the device. Therefore, with just an initial number of 3D simulation, required for meta model fitting, one can predict Ron yield for an entire family of products in a matter of minutes because running any further simulations is no longer necessary. Our experiments show that we can develop accurate meta models (accuracy >99.8%) with as low as 1300 simulations. Furthermore, this meta model can be used to achieve an optimum parametric yield.</p></td></tr>

Low impedance internal nodes of the current mirrors allow to boost gain and bandwidth, adding only high-frequency poles to the frequency response. Therefore, the compensation of the proposed OTA can be achieved through a dominant pole at the output, as in conventional cascode amplifiers. The circuit employs two identical input stages with cross-coupled inputs to improve common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) performance, and a differential-to-single-ended output stage.

The electrodes geometries differ in their metallization ratios. Impedance measurements are performed with DI water to determine the influence of metallization ratio on the electrode capacitance. From these results, the electrode that offers the highest capacitance is further characterized by measurements with ethanol-water mixtures. The results show that there is a decrease in capacitance of 0.1 pF per % increase of ethanol concentration. This is due to the decrease in permittivity as the ethanol concentration increases.

The proposed approach is suitable to be integrated within a complete system targeting heterogeneous FPGA SoCs. When implemented within the Xilinx Zynq XC7Z020 chip, it runs 94 Mega pixels per second and occupies just 18493 LUTs, which is at least 25% faster and 35.5% cheaper than state-of-the-art designs.</p></td></tr>

Indeed, in many computing problems, the requirement of preserving the exact functionality either results in unnecessary overuse of resources or is hardly possible to meet. The latter case is typical of incompletely specified synthesis problems, targeting the hardware implementation of a Boolean function from a partial knowledge of its care set. The missing elements of the care set are named "don't knows". Previous works identified information theory-based decomposition strategies as powerful synthesis tools. Nonetheless, the definition of an automatic method for approximate synthesis is an open problem, and the approximate counterpart of many logic synthesis techniques is still missing. In this paper, we extend a disjoint support decomposition algorithm to target Boolean functions in the presence of "don't knows". Furthermore, we integrate the decomposition in an information theory-based synthesis flow. Relative experiments on the IWLS2020 benchmarks show that, on average, the addition of the designed decomposition to the flow reduces by 15.63% the number of gates and by 12.22% the depth.</p></td></tr>

In addition, they may adopt different kernel sizes along the network, thus making the design of flexible yet efficient hardware architectures highly desirable. This paper presents a reconfigurable accelerator able to runtime adapt its computational capabilities to perform transposed convolution with different kernel sizes. When accommodated within the Xilinx XC7Z020 and XC7K410T chips, the proposed design dissipates less than 95 mW at 125MHz and 179 mW at 250MHz, exhibiting a throughput of 1.95 and 3.9 Giga output per second, respectively.

To overcome this problem we propose a new array structure connecting multiple antennas and rectifiers through a passive network. By using the proposed approach on an N × N array, energy and backscatter range can both be increased by a factor of N. This enables radio frequency identification (RFID) systems in the SHF band to achieve similar coverage as ultra high frequency (UHF)-RFID systems, while gaining the advantage of higher available bandwidth.

Most HAR systems for ultra-low power devices are based on classic Machine Learning (ML) models, whereas Deep Learning (DL), although reaching state-of-the-art accuracy, is less popular due to its high energy consumption, which poses a significant challenge for battery-operated and resource-constrained devices. In this work, we bridge the gap between on-device HAR and DL thanks to a hierarchical architecture composed of a decision tree (DT) and a one dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN). The two classifiers operate in a cascaded fashion on two different sub-tasks: the DT classifies only the easiest activities, while the CNN deals with more complex ones. With experiments on a state-of-the-art dataset and targeting a single-core RISC-V MCU, we show that this approach allows to save up to 67.7% energy w.r.t. a "stand-alone" DL architecture at iso-accuracy.

The system is based on differential impedance measurement of the biological target with nanoparticle amplification. The surface of the sensor is biochemically functionalized with a synthetic peptide to mimic the antigenic determinant of the targeted virion particle. Gold interdigitated microelectrodes are the core of the biosensing system. They are designed in a differential configuration, reference and active sensor, to counteract all possible mismatches such as temperature fluctuations and variations in the ion content of the solution.

In this context, advanced sampling methods for the OC hyper-space are required to offer better coverage with a smaller number of simulations. In addition, machine learning (ML) surrogate models are proposed to be used instead of time-consuming circuit simulations. In this context, we propose and evaluate several advanced sampling methods for the OC hyper-space and show that they provide results similar to the classical verification approach using 3x less simulations.

As a result, Model Order Reduction (MOR) techniques can provide attractive methodologies to reduce the complexity of the original systems. System-theoretic techniques like Balanced Truncation (BT) offer very reliable bounds for the approximation error, compared to moment-matching methods.

The main disadvantages of chopping is the degradation of input impedance and the presence of chopping ripples superposing the recorded neural signal. These ripples are especially critical in sampled systems, as back-folding into the baseband should be avoided. Additionally, loop linearity and stability can be compromised by chopping ripples in feedback systems. This article compares ripple reduction strategies from prior art and presents a mathematical analysis of a simple and effective technique by delayed sampling. A description of the signal chain is derived in order to develop a model, which is subsequently used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method.

In particular, the typical impulse response of an analog-SiPM (aSiPM) with a specific dead-time is replaced by a custom impulse response by means of a microcell-level Pulse Shaper stage. In this way, is possible to tune the pulse to approximate the time-reversed shape of the laser envelope and to perform an analog cross-correlation. Simulations have been carried out in MATLAB software: by using an msSiPM instead of an aSiPM, an advantage in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 6dB and of Signal-to-Background Ratio (SBR) of about 23dB is obtained.</p></td></tr>

Emerging CMOS technologies like 22 nm FDSOI promise to open new perspectives in overcoming power constraints due to their particular energy efficiency in digital circuit integration, they however also pose a challenge for the analogue front-end stages of such systems, especially with respect to signal noise. This paper addresses the design of low noise amplifiers (LNA), the most critical component with respect to power and noise, in this technology and application. Moreover, a trade-off between igs-shot noise and flicker noise is described, which leads to the design of the LNA's operational amplifier, minimising noise for a given current. Capacitor types vary in leakage and hence in noise. We therefore simulated and analysed different types and sizes of DC-decoupling capacitors for an estimation of the minimum-area requirement of the LNA. Notably, the described design approaches the minimum input-referred noise possible for a given current and input capacitor in this technology.</p></td></tr>

Such a high electrodes count generates a large amount of data which poses severe challenges in the design of long-term implantable silicon interfaces that rely on a limited power budget and a narrow transmission bandwidth. In such a scenario, reliable spike detectors are needed, as they allow to transmit only the relevant neural information (the neuron action potential) instead of the whole raw recording. Spike detectors based on energy operators provide a good compromise between detection performance and hardware complexity. However, they require a suitable smoothing filter that affects both area occupation and power dissipation. In this paper, we propose a spike detector based on the cascade of two energy operators, without smoothing, and the use of a new simple adaptative threshold calculation. We show that this technique provides good detection metrics compared to previous approaches, for different SNR levels and with several noise models. The proposed system has been synthesized in 28 nm CMOS showing a per-channel area occupation of 0.0021 mm2 with a power consumption of 0.15 µW, comparing favorably with the state of art of brain machine silicon interfaces.</p></td></tr>

The amplitude of the spikes that can be recognized really depends on the noise present in the recording and the threshold must set a good tradeoff between the false detection of noise fluctuations and the smaller spikes. In this work we demonstrate how common approach to automatic threshold estimation are highly affected by changes in the firing rate of neurons, causing the threshold to become an unreliable yardstick of evaluation between different channels and even within the same recording. For this reason, here we propose a noise estimation method relying on the base 2 logarithm, suitable for the automatic setting of a firing-rate independent threshold for spike detection methods. We compare its performances against other statistical variability indices as the widely used RMS, the mean, and the median of the absolute value of the signal both qualitatively and quantitatively, while varying the firing rate exhibited by the testbench dataset. Our finding indicates that while the RMS and the mean are heavily affected by the firing rate, our proposed method perform almost equally to the median-based estimation, but given the complexity of the latter, poses our method as an optimal solution for application requiring a real-time defining of the threshold.</p></td></tr>

To perform some simple computation in memory, the IMC designs often adopt analog operations, which may incur inevitable computation errors. To recover the accuracy loss, adding some random disturbance in CNN training is a straight-forward approach to make it more tolerant to computation errors. However, random values may be quite different to the real run-time errors caused by non-ideal effects. In this work, we propose a hierarchical simulation framework for the IMC systems to support error-aware CNN training. This framework includes an efficient approach to build accurate IMC behavioral models that reflect real non-ideal effects. By using the behavioral model, an accurate high-level error model can be built efficiently to provide run-time errors for CNN training and error rate verification.

The proposed technique follows a bottom up design scheme. At the bottom level, a multi-objective algorithm (SPEA-2) is employed to obtain the Pareto-optimal front (POF) of a single-stage wide-band amplifier. Then, the obtained Pareto-optimal points (POPs) are combined one by one to constitute the POFs at the higher levels. Here, instead of simulating all possible candidate solutions, we employ an equation-based model including the loading effects of the following stage(s) to estimate the performance at the higher levels. Finally, we extract the final POF from the obtained POPs by using the SPEA-2 selection procedure. Once the POF of a two-stage amplifier is obtained, this circuit is encapsulated as an single amplifier by itself in order to construct the further stages in the hierarchy. Thus, this method can be applied to optimization of multi-stage amplifier circuits regardless of the number of stages. Synthesis results have indicated that a flat optimization approach for a three stage wide-band amplifier requires about 4.5 times the number of iterations compared to the proposed approach for a similar POF, with each iteration requiring a much longer simulation time as well.</p></td></tr>

The advantage in energy consumption of SNN algorithms pre-developed in software is obtained by their transfer to neural application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The neurons and synapses that are used on algorithm level have to be mapped by special circuits on the hardware level. One of the most widely used neuron models due to its low computational complexity and high biological inspiration is the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. In this paper, a modification of an energy-efficient LIF neuron is presented with a novel method to use a refractory period (RP) to generate invariant output spikes. By modifying the RP mechanism, the controllability and stability of entire SNN systems on the circuit level can be significantly improved. Due to the low energy of 1.4 pJ / spike and the invariance of these, it becomes easier to predict the total energy consumption of a large-scale SNN. The concept is verified in measurement by fabricating the circuit in a 130nm BiCMOS process.</p></td></tr>

Among all available architectures, Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays are the most prominent ones. They permit to efficiently accelerate several classes of data-intensive algorithms without giving up architecture versatility, and their use in machine learning applications is becoming increasingly widespread. In particular, the typical workload of Convolutional Neural Networks fits very well on this kind of architecture. Unfortunately, their use in the most advanced Graph Neural Networks is not well investigated. Graph Neural Network algorithms apply to all kinds of use cases that are characterized by non-euclidean data, such as computer vision, natural language processing, traffic forecasting, chemistry, and recommendation systems. In this work, we analyse the most relevant Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array devices and Graph Neural Network models. Our contribution includes a comparison between the hardware architectures and their use for the inference of Graph Neural Network models.

However, its reliance on Gaussian Process models, which operate only on continuous-valued spaces, reduces its applicability in realworld scenarios, where multiple discrete-valued variables often exist. In this paper, we propose an approach to mitigate this issue by using a Deep Learning scheme to transform devices parametrizations to continuous ones, where classic BO can be applied. Specifically, a composite architecture that consists of a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a dense Neural Network is built to define a continuous representation of integrated inductors in a TSMC 90nm process. By optimizing using these representations, we overcome the limitation of discretevalued variables. Experimental results on a Low Noise Amplifier highlight the efficiency of the proposed approach.</p></td></tr>

We apply our technique to a third-order, single-bit, low-pass continuous-time delta-sigma modulator in cascaded integrator feedback structure, implemented in a 0.35-μm CMOS process. A tuning scheme for the reference currents of the feedback DACs is derived as a function of the individual TC errors and verified by circuit simulations. We confirm the tuning technique experimentally on the fabricated circuit over a TC parameter variation range of ±20 %. Stable modulator operation is achieved for all parameter sets.

On the other hand, the model performance is enhanced in the subthreshold regime adding off-state current. This behavioral model is built by using one PMOS transistor and two behavioral current sources. Then, the Level 3 DC model parameters are obtained fitting the model equations to the low-voltage pentacene-based OTFT data using previously studied metaheuristics-based parameter extraction approach. Finally, the behavioral model based on Level 3 model is simulated in LTspice while the gate and drain voltages are both ranging from 0 to –3 V.

Its equivalent LTSPICE library model includes activation thresholds and a differentiable sigmoid function, which prevents convergence problems.
