However, as the complexity of analog design cases tackled by these methodologies increases, a broader set of topological constraints must be supported to cover different layout styles and circuit classes. Here, model-independent differentiable encodings for regularity, boundary, and symmetry island (SI) constraints are described, and an unsupervised loss function is used for the artificial neural network (ANN) model to learn how to generate placements that follow them. As only sizing data is required for its training, it discards the need to acquire legacy layouts containing insights of these types of constraints. The model is ultimately used to produce floorplans from scratch, at push-button speed, for state-of-the-art analog structures, including technology nodes not used for its training.</p></td></tr>

Therefore, worst-case estimates are usually applied which results in overdesign and, thus, waste of area and power consumption. Moreover, simulation of almost final designs is extremely computational expensive usually avoiding iteration loops. In order to enable both early performance estimates and fast iteration runs, we combined parasitic layout estimation through templates in generators with SystemC-based parameterizable modelling. As the result, we can run layout-aware performance estimates of a capacitive pipeline ADC within a runtime of only about one minute per iteration. Using this estimation in a loop, we analyzed and optimized the generator parameters of a capacitor array in order to improve the ADC’s performance.</p></td></tr>

In analog layout design, the parasitics induced by interconnecting wires and elements affect the accuracy and performance of the device. Due to the requirement of low-power and high-speed, the series of lateral metal-metal very small capacitor units as the architecture of capacitor array is usually adopted. Besides power consumption and area reduction, the parasitic capacitance would significantly affect the matching properties and setting time of capacitors. This work presents a framework to synthesize good-quality binary-weighted capacitors for custom advanced node planar SAR ADC. Also, this work proposed a parasitic-aware ILP-based routing algorithm, which can generate an optimized layout considering parasitic capacitance and capacitance ratio mismatch simultaneously.

For this, superconductive solid-state electronic circuits are considered to be promising candidates. First demonstrations for suitability are known.

However, optimizations considering process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) corners or layout still pose unprecedented challenges in applying these tools due to the high simulation times and different simulator convergence issues. This paper proposes two different deep learning (DL) models to assist the PVT-inclusive simulation-based sizing process of RF ICs, and more specifically, voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs). Given specific devices’ dimensions, the 1st model classifies the likeability of the circuit to convergence for nominal and PVT corners, bypassing solutions that will hardly procedure valuable information for the optimization process, while the 2nd model predicts the VCOs’ oscillating frequencies for the aforementioned conditions. The methodology is tested on a state-of-the-art VCO, reducing 19% of the workload of the circuit simulator, ultimately saving almost 5 days of computational effort and with improvement on the optimization result.</p></td></tr>

To ensure a high yield, design engineers are considering certain manufacturing limits of the devices. Estimation of the yield is not a trivial process as it is influenced by multiple design parameters therefore a detailed modeling of the device and high precision simulation is required. A large amount of simulation is required for this task and performing this analysis on a family of devices results in running thousands of simulations which is a very time consuming process (e.g a single finite element simulation may take tens of minutes). In this paper we propose a yield estimation method based on 3D finite element simulations. The proposed method consists of developing a prediction meta model, which has as inputs the design properties (geometry and material) of a power transistor and estimates On-State Resistance (Ron) of the device. Therefore, with just an initial number of 3D simulation, required for meta model fitting, one can predict Ron yield for an entire family of products in a matter of minutes because running any further simulations is no longer necessary. Our experiments show that we can develop accurate meta models (accuracy >99.8%) with as low as 1300 simulations. Furthermore, this meta model can be used to achieve an optimum parametric yield.</p></td></tr>

Verification in all possible operating condition (OC) configurations is practically impossible, due to the high number of OCs and the huge size of the OC hyper-space. In this context, advanced sampling methods for the OC hyper-space are required to offer better coverage with a smaller number of simulations. In addition, machine learning (ML) surrogate models are proposed to be used instead of time-consuming circuit simulations. In this context, we propose and evaluate several advanced sampling methods for the OC hyper-space and show that they provide results similar to the classical verification approach using 3x less simulations. Moreover, we show that training a ML surrogate model on this data leads to a much more effective model, that can be subsequently used to identify the circuit’s actual worst cases.</p></td></tr>

The problem is induced by the large current density in circuit interconnections. However, in most cases, EM stress is more pronounced in the vias and the blocking points of the interconnects. As a result, Model Order Reduction (MOR) techniques can provide attractive methodologies to reduce the complexity of the original systems. System-theoretic techniques like Balanced Truncation (BT) offer very reliable bounds for the approximation error, compared to moment-matching methods.

To perform some simple computation in memory, the IMC designs often adopt analog operations, which may incur inevitable computation errors. To recover the accuracy loss, adding some random disturbance in CNN training is a straight-forward approach to make it more tolerant to computation errors. However, random values may be quite different to the real run-time errors caused by non-ideal effects. In this work, we propose a hierarchical simulation framework for the IMC systems to support error-aware CNN training. This framework includes an efficient approach to build accurate IMC behavioral models that reflect real non-ideal effects. By using the behavioral model, an accurate high-level error model can be built efficiently to provide run-time errors for CNN training and error rate verification.

The proposed technique follows a bottom up design scheme. At the bottom level, a multi-objective algorithm (SPEA-2) is employed to obtain the Pareto-optimal front (POF) of a single-stage wide-band amplifier. Then, the obtained Pareto-optimal points (POPs) are combined one by one to constitute the POFs at the higher levels. Here, instead of simulating all possible candidate solutions, we employ an equation-based model including the loading effects of the following stage(s) to estimate the performance at the higher levels. Finally, we extract the final POF from the obtained POPs by using the SPEA-2 selection procedure. Once the POF of a two-stage amplifier is obtained, this circuit is encapsulated as an single amplifier by itself in order to construct the further stages in the hierarchy. Thus, this method can be applied to optimization of multi-stage amplifier circuits regardless of the number of stages. Synthesis results have indicated that a flat optimization approach for a three stage wide-band amplifier requires about 4.5 times the number of iterations compared to the proposed approach for a similar POF, with each iteration requiring a much longer simulation time as well.</p></td></tr>

Once the SFT is available, quantitative fault tree analysis (FTA) is carried out using analytical approaches, e.g., probabilistic model checking and theorem proving. While the former is limited to exponential distributions, the latter can analyze fault trees (FT)s with arbitrary probability distributions. This paper proposes to combine model checking-based automatic FT generation and theorem proving based FTA to ensure a more rigorous and complete approach for FTA. The proposed approach particularly utilizes 1) the xSAP safety assessment platform to automatically generate SFTs from a functionally verified system model and 2) the HOL4 theorem prover to analyze the xSAP-generated SFTs.

Specifically, a composite architecture that consists of a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a dense Neural Network is built to define a continuous representation of integrated inductors in a TSMC 90nm process.
