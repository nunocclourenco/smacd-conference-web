    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Instructions for authors</h2>
    <p>Dear Authors,</p>
    <p><br/>the SMACD and PRIME conferences are approaching. <br/><b>We therefore would like to draw your attention to the following information:</b></p>
    
    <h3>1. Schedule</h3>
    <p>Please, verify in the program the time slot allocated to your presentation.</p>
    <h3>2. Record your video presentation </h3>
    <p>Some important instructions about how to record your video presentation. Please follow them carefully. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your video presentation should be <b>max. 15 min long</b>.</li>
      <li>Please provide your recording in the format <b>16:9 landscape</b>.</li>
      <li>Videos should always be submitted in <b>MP4 format</b> with a resolution of <b>720p (1280 x 720 pixel)</b> to <b>1080p (1920 x 1080 pixel)</b>. For best results, we recommend a constant bit rate of 60 fps (frames per second.</li>	
      <li>Name your file as Session ID-Author Name e.g., SMACD-A4.1_Georg or PRIME-A.1.2_Georg (check in the program).</li>	 
    </ul>
    <p>There are numerous software solutions that help you create a professional-looking screen recording. We can recommend two tools that most speakers will likely have installed on their PC or Mac.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have created your presentation using PowerPoint, you can also use the built-in PowerPoint feature that lets you record an on-screen presentation with voiceover narration and camera input. The video narration feature, however, only works when you are using a Windows OS. :-(Users of other OS may have to use additional tools that allow them to add their camera feed to the recording. You can also follow instructions at: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/turn-your-presentation-into-a-video-c140551f-cb37-4818-b5d4-3e30815c3e83" target="_blank">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/turn-your-presentation-into-a-video-c140551f-cb37-4818-b5d4-3e30815c3e83</a> )</li>
      <li>Another useful tool worth consideration the video conferencing platform Zoom. Its free version offers extensive options to record one’s own screen with a separate window showing the webcam view. You can find more information on Zoom’s local recording feature here: <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-recording" target="_blank">https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-recording</a>  </li>

    </ul>



    <h3>3. Upload your video presentation</h3>
    
    <p>We expect all authors to make a live presentation during the conference at the scheduled times in the program, but as a back-up solution, we kindly ask authors to upload their presentations as ppt or video-recorded presentation (ppt, pdf, MP4 video)” latest by July 10, 2021, via the link below: </p>
