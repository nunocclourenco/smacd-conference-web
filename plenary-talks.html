	<p>The 1,5-year Power Electronics and Microelectronics Master curriculum at Reutlingen University is centered around a one-year team laboratory project. In this project, starting from day zero of the curriculum, students gain hands-on experience with the joint development of a complex electronic system with microelectronic and power electronics components from specification capture over system architecture, ASIC, and PCB design to prototype implementation and test. Recent project assignments include the design of delta-sigma, or PWM modulated Class D audio amplifiers with gallium nitride power devices and developing a sensorless power controller for a switched reluctance motor. All assignments include the design of an analog or mixed-signal CMOS ASIC for signal processing and control purposes.</p>
	<p>In this talk, I will present our learning-by-doing approach to teaching electronics design and discuss the organizational, technological, and financial requirements that must be met to make such complex projects feasible with students that have had little, if any, previous exposure to the theory and practice of ASIC design.</p>

	<p>Eckhard Hennig received his Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany, in 1994 and the Dr.-Ing. degree from the University of Kaiserlautern, Germany, in 2000. Since 2015, he is a professor of digital and integrated circuit design at Reutlingen University, Germany. His current research and teaching activities include mixed-signal system modeling and CMOS circuit design for power electronics applications.</p>

<p>Many years ago, when I began my research career, there were very few tools to aid research, and one used one's ingenuity, imagination, and intuition; in short, the brain. After many years, powerful tools generate answers to research questions: The response is very fast, increasingly anticipating the answer and, for this reason, replacing the brain. In essence, research uses fingers to stimulate (and not guide) the tools. The situation is, in substance, a challenge between man and robot, and man can win by using his brain and not his fingers.</p>
<p>The presentation traces the evolution of research tools and indicates the advantages of a proper use and the risks of a dull utilization.</p>
