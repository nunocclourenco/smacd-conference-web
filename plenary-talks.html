		<p class="intro">VLSI, Circuit Design, Technology Scaling, Moore’s Law, EDA. They are our own highly specialized areas of expertise and it often feels like our discipline is quite different from other fields in engineering. Indeed, the many decades of exponential growth are unique to our field and have presented numerous challenges that were met by researchers in this area with clever solutions. But at the core of our work we find four steps that we take over and over again. We observe phenomena, make physical or empirical models for them, analyze their behavior as it impacts our goals, create mathematical models that we can use to simulate and predict the behaviors, and finally apply optimization or improvement techniques to create the best possible outcome. These four activities are universal across engineering practice, and it is useful to reflect on how our own tricks and techniques -many innovated in response to the severe scaling challenges the community has had to go through, are good lessons to apply in other fields of engineering or even in medicine.</p>

	<p>Sani Nassif received his PhD from Carnegie-Mellon university in the eighties. He worked for ten years at Bell Laboratories on various aspects of design and technology coupling. He then joined IBM Research where he was for eighteen years working on DFM in various technical and management roles. In 2014 he formed Radyalis to apply EDA techniques to Cancer Radiation Therapy. Sani is a fellow of the IEEE, a member of the IBM Academy of Technology, and an IBM master inventor with 70+ patents. He was the president of IEEE CEDA in 2014-2016, and has published and presented widely.</p>

	<p class="intro"> In this decade, we are witnessing an acceleration of computing and communication capabilities due to both the need of providing better cyber services and to the power of new AI/ML methods. The key ingredients for this progress are the availability of evolutionary and revolutionary technologies and the capability to master new and complex design through electronic design automation (EDA). This talk will address digital logic design for emerging technologies. In particular, I will review challenges and opportunities for various 3D CMOS technologies and their extension to hybrid 3D structures for Logic in Memory systems. I will consider next the revolution in EDA demanded by cryo-technologies, ranging from superconducting quantum-flux technologies to quantum computing platforms. I will conclude by outlining extensions and limitations of computing systems at the dawn of the singularity. </p>
