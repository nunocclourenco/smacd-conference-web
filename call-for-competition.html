<p class="lead">As usual in SMACD Conferences, the 2019 edition will also hold a thrilling and dynamic event 
where MSc and PhD students can compete for the $1,000 prize sponsored by <a href="http://ieee-ceda.org" target="_blank">IEEE CEDA</a> with their best ideas, methodologies,
flows and tools with one unique yet challenging goal:</p>
<p class="center bold lead">“To improve design automation for integrated circuits and systems”</p>

  <h2 class="featurette-heading"> Topics of Interest </h2>
          <p>Modeling, simulation and synthesis for
analog, mixed-signal, RF, multidomain (such
as MEMS, nanoelectronic, optoelectronic,
biological).
</p>



</div><div class="col-md-7">

<h2 class="featurette-heading"> HOW TO ENTER THE COMPETITION ? </h2>
<p>All participants must submit a paper (following the same SMACD
2019 submission guidelines) with a description of the methodology
and/or tool, the design problem of their choice and the solution
provided by their methodology and/or tool.</p>
<p > <b > The first author of the submission and presenter at the conference
must be a MSc or a PhD student!</b></p>

<h2 class="featurette-heading">Evaluation Criteria</h2>

<p>A Judging Committee will select the winner(s) based on the quality of the
paper, of its presentation at the conference and the live demonstration,
using the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Complexity of the problem posed in the paper.</li>
<li>Level of automation (e.g., fully automated, user-assisted, etc.).</li>
<li>Designer interface (e.g., problem setup, result analysis, etc.).</li>
<li>Applicability of the proposal (e.g., general approach or restricted to
special problems, circuit classes or sizes, etc.).</li>
<li>Robustness of the design solutions (e.g.,
against parasitics, variability, etc.) and of
the proposal itself (e.g. convergence,
insensitivity to input and/or
starting values, etc.).</li>
<li>Integration degree with commercial design suites and design
methodologies (e.g., import and export data from these suites,
usability in one or more steps of current design flows, etc.).</li>
</ul>

	    <h2 class="featurette-heading"> Important Notes</h2>

<ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
<li>All accepted submissions in the competition
will be presented by the students in special
sessions at the conference and published in
the conference proceedings.</li>
<li>The presenters must perform a live demo of
the methodologies and/or tool.</li>
<li>SMACD organization guarantees internet
connection to all participants, but required
CAD tools or design kits licensing is in
responsibility of each participant.</li>
<li>Papers not accepted for the competition
short-list event will still be considered by the
technical program commitee for the SMACD
2019 regular sessions.
