<h2> HOW TO ENTER THE COMPETITION ? </h2>
<p>
	All participants must submit a paper (following the same SMACD 2023
submission guidelines) with a description of the methodology and/or
tool, the design problem of their choice and the solution provided by
their methodology and/or tool.</p>
<p class="intro alternative-color"> <b >The first author of the submission and presenter at the conference must be a MSc or a PhD student!</b></p>

<h2> Important Notes</h2>

<ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
<li>All accepted submissions in the competition will be <b>presented by the students in special sessions and published in the conference proceedings</b>.</li>
<li>The presenters <b >must perform a live demo</b> of the methodologies/tools.</li>
<li>SMACD organization guarantees internet connection to all participants, but required CAD tools or design kits licensing are the <b>responsibility of each participant.</b>.</li>
<li>Papers not accepted for the competition short-list <b>will</b> still <b>be considered</b> by the technical program committee <b>for the SMACD 023 regular sessions</b>.</li></ul>

		<h2 >Evaluation Criteria</h2>
		<p>A Judging Committee will select the winner(s) based on the quality of the paper, of its presentation at the conference, 
			and the live demonstration, using the following criteria:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><b class="alternative-color">Complexity</b> of the problem posed in the paper.</li>
		<li><b class="alternative-color">Level of automation</b> (e.g., fully automated, user-assisted, etc.).</li>
		<li><b class="alternative-color">Designer interface</b> (e.g., problem setup, result analysis, etc.).</li>
		<li><b class="alternative-color">Applicability of the proposal</b> (e.g., general approach or restricted to special problems, 
			circuit classes or sizes, etc.).</li>
		<li><b class="alternative-color">Robustness</b> of the design solutions (e.g., against parasitics, variability, etc.) and, of the proposal itself (e.g. convergence, insensitivity to input and starting values, etc.).</li>
		<li><b class="alternative-color">Integration</b> degree with commercial design suites and design methodologies (e.g., import and export data from these suites, usability in one or more steps of current design flows, etc.).</li>
