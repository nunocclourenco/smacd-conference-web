		<p class="intro" >Xyce is an open source, highly accurate, and massively parallel SPICE circuit simulator developed at Sandia National Laboratories. The Xyce Python Model Interpreter (Xyce-PyMi), also developed at Sandia, enables the execution of devices with behavior defined in Python as part of a larger circuit simulation using Xyce. This allows the circuit designers to rapidly generate models from data and to evaluate circuit performances in a production circuit simulator, leading to a robust and higher confidence design.</p>
		<p>	In this tutorial, starting with an introduction to Xyce, the audience will be guided through installation of Xyce-PyMi, development of an electrical device defined in Python, and will be given resources for use in developing more complicated data-driven device models using Python packages such as TensorFlow.</p>

	<p class="intro" >This tutorial shows how to use Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for the optimization and automated design of analog and mixed-signal ICs. A survey of main (conventional) 
		design methods and EDA tools is given to show the pros and cons of the prior art, as a motivation towards using ANNs as optimization engines. 
		A step-by-step methodology is given to explain the key aspects to consider in the presented approach, such as dataset preparation, ANN modeling and optimization, 
		and their application to a given design problem.  Several case studies are considered as demonstration vehicles and examples at different hierarchy levels 
		of analog IC design. The first one is based on the use of ANNs and spice-like simulators to optimize amplifiers (AIDAsoft) and the second one consists of 
		combining ANNs and behavioral simulation (SIMSIDES) for the high-level sizing of Sigma-Delta Modulators (&Sigma;&Delta;Ms). The tutorial is addressed to a general audience interested in learning the fundamentals and practical considerations of using ANNs as optimization engines for the automated design of analog and mixed-signal ICs.

	<p class="intro" >Finding the optimum design parameters in analog circuit design is a tedious and lengthy process, requiring a large number of simulations across PVT corners. 
		To ease this process the Analog Design Environment (ADE) will provide the capability to run a trained model users can plug in via an API. 
		The impact of the design optimization capabilities can be monitored real time by the designer through design space visualization capabilities in ADE. 
		In this tutorial we will introduce you to these new capabilities of this open framework called “ADE Advanced Optimization” along with a demo based on a design example.
