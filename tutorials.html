		<p class="intro" >Xyce is an open source, highly accurate, and massively parallel SPICE circuit simulator developed at Sandia National Laboratories. The Xyce Python Model Interpreter (Xyce-PyMi), also developed at Sandia, enables the execution of devices with behavior defined in Python as part of a larger circuit simulation using Xyce. This allows the circuit designers to rapidly generate models from data and to evaluate circuit performances in a production circuit simulator, leading to a robust and higher confidence design.</p>
		<p>	In this tutorial, starting with an introduction to Xyce, the audience will be guided through installation of Xyce-PyMi, development of an electrical device defined in Python, and will be given resources for use in developing more complicated data-driven device models using Python packages such as TensorFlow.</p>

	<p>Shahed Reza is an R&D manager at Sandia National Laboratories. His department is involved in research activities on physics-based device and subsystem modelling methodologies. Prior to joining Sandia, he worked at multiple companies in different R&D positions. He was an RF/MW device modeling expert at Raytheon’s state of the art Gallium nitride (GaN) Fabrication facility. He worked as an analog RF and microwave circuit designer at Keysight (formerly Agilent) technologies. He was a Research Scientist at Philips Medical Systems, where he conducted research on image guided noise tomography and RF probes for Magnetic Resonance imaging. He was a Silicon design lead at the Imaging and printing Division of Hewlett-Packard.</p>
	<p>Dr. Reza has eight US patents and over 60 technical publications in peer reviewed journals and conferences. He earned his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Florida. The topic of his doctoral research was flicker and Generation-recombination noise properties of carbon nanotubes and silicon nanowires. </p>

	<p class="intro" >This tutorial shows how to use Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for the optimization and automated design of analog and mixed-signal ICs. A survey of main (conventional) 
		design methods and EDA tools is given to show the pros and cons of the prior art, as a motivation towards using ANNs as optimization engines. 
		A step-by-step methodology is given to explain the key aspects to consider in the presented approach, such as dataset preparation, ANN modeling and optimization, 
		and their application to a given design problem.  Several case studies are considered as demonstration vehicles and examples at different hierarchy levels 
		of analog IC design. The first one is based on the use of ANNs and spice-like simulators to optimize amplifiers (AIDAsoft) and the second one consists of 
		combining ANNs and behavioral simulation (SIMSIDES) for the high-level sizing of Sigma-Delta Modulators (&Sigma;&Delta;Ms). The tutorial is addressed to a general audience interested in learning the fundamentals and practical considerations of using ANNs as optimization engines for the automated design of analog and mixed-signal ICs.
