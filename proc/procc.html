        <p class="lead">Welcome to SMACD 2022!</p>
          
        <p class="intro">The <b class="base-color">International Conference on Synthesis, 
          Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation Methods and Applications to Circuit Design</b> returns to Italy in its 18th edition, hosted in the stunning south Sardinia at the beautiful tanka Village resort in Villasimius. 
          SMACD 2022 received 63 submissions from authors spreading through nations from Europe, Asia, Africa and America. The Technical Program Committee, led by the TPC Chairs, Francisco Fernandez, Ralf Sommer, and Ricardo Martins, carried out the difficult job of selecting 45 papers for oral presentation, around 70% of submitted ones. 
        <p class="intro">In this edition, for the first time, we will also host an inspirational Women in Circuits and Systems (WiCAS) & Young Professionals (YP) event organized by Giulia di Capua and Elisabetta Moisello. SMACD's mission has also taken shape through the EDA Competition. This year, in its 8th edition, organized by Fabio Passos and Kemal Ozanoglu, four student contestants will perform a live demo of their tools. The winner will take home the invaluable recognition and feedback of the Jury and an exciting IEEE CEDA-sponsored prize of $1,000. The winner of the EDA Competition and Best Paper Awardees will be assigned during the conference awarding ceremony.</p>
        
        <p class="intro">Once again, SMACD and PRIME have been co-located. My warmest thanks to everyone involved in the Organizing Committee. A particular word of appreciation to PRIME's General Chair, Franco Maloberti, and TPC Chair, Edoardo Bonizzoni, for supporting and receiving SMACD in their country. I also like to recognize Pragma Congressi in the person of Marta Dafarra for their unwavering help in making SMACD 2022. Thanks to the SMACD Steering committee for their never-ending support, motivation, and friendship. </p>
        
        <p class="intro">I thank our Technical sponsors, IEEE, IEEE Circuits and Systems Society, and IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation, and the Institutional sponsorships from the University of Pavia, Instituto de Telecomunicações, and Universidade de Évora.

          <p>The 1,5-year Power Electronics and Microelectronics Master curriculum at Reutlingen University is centered around a one-year team laboratory project. In this project, starting from day zero of the curriculum, students gain hands-on experience with the joint development of a complex electronic system with microelectronic and power electronics components from specification capture over system architecture, ASIC, and PCB design to prototype implementation and test. Recent project assignments include the design of delta-sigma, or PWM modulated Class D audio amplifiers with gallium nitride power devices and developing a sensorless power controller for a switched reluctance motor. All assignments include the design of an analog or mixed-signal CMOS ASIC for signal processing and control purposes.</p>
          <p>In this talk, I will present our learning-by-doing approach to teaching electronics design and discuss the organizational, technological, and financial requirements that must be met to make such complex projects feasible with students that have had little, if any, previous exposure to the theory and practice of ASIC design.</p>

        <p>Many years ago, when I began my research career, there were very few tools to aid research, and one used one's ingenuity, imagination, and intuition; in short, the brain. After many years, powerful tools generate answers to research questions: The response is very fast, increasingly anticipating the answer and, for this reason, replacing the brain. In essence, research uses fingers to stimulate (and not guide) the tools. The situation is, in substance, a challenge between man and robot, and man can win by using his brain and not his fingers.</p>

However, as the complexity of analog design cases tackled by these methodologies increases, a broader set of topological constraints must be supported to cover different layout styles and circuit classes. Here, model-independent differentiable encodings for regularity, boundary, and symmetry island (SI) constraints are described, and an unsupervised loss function is used for the artificial neural network (ANN) model to learn how to generate placements that follow them. As only sizing data is required for its training, it discards the need to acquire legacy layouts containing insights of these types of constraints. The model is ultimately used to produce floorplans from scratch, at push-button speed, for state-of-the-art analog structures, including technology nodes not used for its training.</p></td></tr>

Moreover, simulation of almost final designs is extremely computational expensive usually avoiding iteration loops. In order to enable both early performance estimates and fast iteration runs, we combined parasitic layout estimation through templates in generators with SystemC-based parameterizable modelling. As the result, we can run layout-aware performance estimates of a capacitive pipeline ADC within a runtime of only about one minute per iteration. Using this estimation in a loop, we analyzed and optimized the generator parameters of a capacitor array in order to improve the ADC’s performance.</p></td></tr>

In analog layout design, the parasitics induced by interconnecting wires and elements affect the accuracy and performance of the device. Due to the requirement of low-power and high-speed, the series of lateral metal-metal very small capacitor units as the architecture of capacitor array is usually adopted. Besides power consumption and area reduction, the parasitic capacitance would significantly affect the matching properties and setting time of capacitors. This work presents a framework to synthesize good-quality binary-weighted capacitors for custom advanced node planar SAR ADC. Also, this work proposed a parasitic-aware ILP-based routing algorithm, which can generate an optimized layout considering parasitic capacitance and capacitance ratio mismatch simultaneously.

To ensure a high yield, design engineers are considering certain manufacturing limits of the devices. Estimation of the yield is not a trivial process as it is influenced by multiple design parameters therefore a detailed modeling of the device and high precision simulation is required. A large amount of simulation is required for this task and performing this analysis on a family of devices results in running thousands of simulations which is a very time consuming process (e.g a single finite element simulation may take tens of minutes). In this paper we propose a yield estimation method based on 3D finite element simulations. The proposed method consists of developing a prediction meta model, which has as inputs the design properties (geometry and material) of a power transistor and estimates On-State Resistance (Ron) of the device. Therefore, with just an initial number of 3D simulation, required for meta model fitting, one can predict Ron yield for an entire family of products in a matter of minutes because running any further simulations is no longer necessary. Our experiments show that we can develop accurate meta models (accuracy >99.8%) with as low as 1300 simulations. Furthermore, this meta model can be used to achieve an optimum parametric yield.</p></td></tr>

The problem is induced by the large current density in circuit interconnections. However, in most cases, EM stress is more pronounced in the vias and the blocking points of the interconnects. As a result, Model Order Reduction (MOR) techniques can provide attractive methodologies to reduce the complexity of the original systems. System-theoretic techniques like Balanced Truncation (BT) offer very reliable bounds for the approximation error, compared to moment-matching methods. In this paper, we apply a computationally efficient low-rank BT algorithm based on the extended Krylov subspace method, that can handle large-scale models and significantly accelerate the EM stress analysis. Experimental results on the industrial IBM power grid benchmarks demonstrate that our method can achieve a speedup up to 238x over a standard transient analysis method and a speedup up to 15x over COMSOL, while exhibiting negligible error.</p></td></tr>

To perform some simple computation in memory, the IMC designs often adopt analog operations, which may incur inevitable computation errors. To recover the accuracy loss, adding some random disturbance in CNN training is a straight-forward approach to make it more tolerant to computation errors. However, random values may be quite different to the real run-time errors caused by non-ideal effects. In this work, we propose a hierarchical simulation framework for the IMC systems to support error-aware CNN training. This framework includes an efficient approach to build accurate IMC behavioral models that reflect real non-ideal effects. By using the behavioral model, an accurate high-level error model can be built efficiently to provide run-time errors for CNN training and error rate verification. As shown in the simulation results, the error-aware CNN training with the proposed models efficiently improves the CNN accuracy in real applications with almost no accuracy loss.</p></td></tr>

The proposed technique follows a bottom up design scheme. At the bottom level, a multi-objective algorithm (SPEA-2) is employed to obtain the Pareto-optimal front (POF) of a single-stage wide-band amplifier. Then, the obtained Pareto-optimal points (POPs) are combined one by one to constitute the POFs at the higher levels. Here, instead of simulating all possible candidate solutions, we employ an equation-based model including the loading effects of the following stage(s) to estimate the performance at the higher levels. Finally, we extract the final POF from the obtained POPs by using the SPEA-2 selection procedure. Once the POF of a two-stage amplifier is obtained, this circuit is encapsulated as an single amplifier by itself in order to construct the further stages in the hierarchy. Thus, this method can be applied to optimization of multi-stage amplifier circuits regardless of the number of stages. Synthesis results have indicated that a flat optimization approach for a three stage wide-band amplifier requires about 4.5 times the number of iterations compared to the proposed approach for a similar POF, with each iteration requiring a much longer simulation time as well.</p></td></tr>

Once the SFT is available, quantitative fault tree analysis (FTA) is carried out using analytical approaches, e.g., probabilistic model checking and theorem proving. While the former is limited to exponential distributions, the latter can analyze fault trees (FT)s with arbitrary probability distributions. This paper proposes to combine model checking-based automatic FT generation and theorem proving based FTA to ensure a more rigorous and complete approach for FTA. The proposed approach particularly utilizes 1) the xSAP safety assessment platform to automatically generate SFTs from a functionally verified system model and 2) the HOL4 theorem prover to analyze the xSAP-generated SFTs.

Its correct functioning and applicability in complex electronic schemes are established.</p></td></tr>

That is why they are commonly taught in the courses of study for electrical engineers. Despite hundreds of papers and books on MOSFETs the intuitive explanation of its behavior rises questions of the students especially for the explanation of saturation behavior. Why is the current limited by the charge carriers that are in the semiconductor substrate and form the inversion layer? There is an almost infinite reservoir available from the battery and the terminals, isn't there? Why do the sets of characteristic curves not continue to follow the parabola instead of remaining constant from the peak point (transition from linear to saturation region)? The paper shows both the consistent and causal derivation of the Level 1 MOSFET behavior from a few equations and the illustrative explanations for students to understand this behavior. Finally, an outlook is given on today’s MOSFET models and the difficulties in interpreting especially their AC parameters.</p></td></tr>
