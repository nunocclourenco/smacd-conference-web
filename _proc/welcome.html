        <p class="lead">Welcome to SMACD 2022!</p>
          
        <p class="intro">The <b class="base-color">International Conference on Synthesis, 
          Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation Methods and Applications to Circuit Design</b> returns to Italy in its 18th edition, hosted in the stunning south Sardinia at the beautiful tanka Village resort in Villasimius. 
          SMACD 2022 received 63 submissions from authors spreading through nations from Europe, Asia, Africa and America. The Technical Program Committee, led by the TPC Chairs, Francisco Fernandez, Ralf Sommer, and Ricardo Martins, carried out the difficult job of selecting 45 papers for oral presentation, around 70% of submitted ones. 
        <p class="intro">In this edition, for the first time, we will also host an inspirational Women in Circuits and Systems (WiCAS) & Young Professionals (YP) event organized by Giulia di Capua and Elisabetta Moisello. SMACD's mission has also taken shape through the EDA Competition. This year, in its 8th edition, organized by Fabio Passos and Kemal Ozanoglu, four student contestants will perform a live demo of their tools. The winner will take home the invaluable recognition and feedback of the Jury and an exciting IEEE CEDA-sponsored prize of $1,000. The winner of the EDA Competition and Best Paper Awardees will be assigned during the conference awarding ceremony.</p>
        
        <p class="intro">Once again, SMACD and PRIME have been co-located. My warmest thanks to everyone involved in the Organizing Committee. A particular word of appreciation to PRIME's General Chair, Franco Maloberti, and TPC Chair, Edoardo Bonizzoni, for supporting and receiving SMACD in their country. I also like to recognize Pragma Congressi in the person of Marta Dafarra for their unwavering help in making SMACD 2022. Thanks to the SMACD Steering committee for their never-ending support, motivation, and friendship. </p>
        
        <p class="intro">I thank our Technical sponsors, IEEE, IEEE Circuits and Systems Society, and IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation, and the Institutional sponsorships from the University of Pavia, Instituto de Telecomunicações, and Universidade de Évora. Moreover, thanks to Edoardo Bonizzoni and Rafael Castro Lopez, we are tremendously fortunate to have Power Integration, INVENTVM, Infineon, Synopsys, ST Microelectronics, Bosh,  Huawei, and Photeon as Platinum Sponsors; Cadence, Europractice, Allegro, Analog Devices, FBK Fondazione Bruno Kessler and TDK Corporation as Gold Sponsors; and Renessas as Silver Sponsor.</p>
        
        <p class="intro">Finally, I would like to express my most significant and sincere appreciation to all the Authors who submitted their papers to the conference, all the Delegates, and, Tutorial and Plenary speakers. SMACD has provided some unforgettable moments close to many friends through the years. I hope that you positively enjoy this 2022 edition, meeting old friends and making new ones for years to come.</p>
