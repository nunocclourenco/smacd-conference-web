  <h2>Call for IC Design Contest</h2>

  <h3>COMPETE FOR THE $1,000 AND JOIN THE HALL-OF-FAME</h3>

  <p>The 2025 edition of the SMACD Conference, which will take place at Istanbul, Turkiye, from the 7nd to the 10th of July, will also hold a thrilling and dynamic event where M.Sc. and Ph.D. students can compete with their best use of EDA methodologies, to reach one unique yet challenging goal:</p>
  
  <h3>ENHANCE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS DESIGN</h3>

  <p>The winner(s) of the event will receive a prize of $1,000 sponsored by.</p>

  <h3>HOW TO ENTER THE COMPETITION?</h3>

  <p>All participants must submit a paper (following SMACD 2025 submission guidelines) that fits into one or more of the following categories:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Novel IC designs whose performances compete within the state-of-the-art of its research field (at least including Post-Layout simulations);</li>
    <li>IC designs where at least one step of its development flow was partially (or fully) assisted by custom/academic Computer-Aided Design and/or Electronic Design Automation tools;</li>
    <li>IC designs clearly identifying one or more steps of the development flow that would greatly benefit from the development of new Computer-Aided Design and/or Electronic Design Automation tools.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The layout of the circuit must be present and a prototype test is considered an added value. The first author of the submission and presenter at the conference must be a MSc or a PhD student!</p>

  <h3>EVALUATION CRITERIA</h3>

  <p>A Judging Committee will select the winner(s) based on the quality of the paper, the presentation at the conference, and the Q&A during the special session, using the following criteria:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Complexity of the problem posed in the paper.</li>
    <li>Level of EDA support to reach the presented IC design.</li>
    <li>Robustness of the design solutions (e.g., against parasitics, variability, etc.).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>TOPICS OF INTEREST</h3>

  <p>IC designs resulting or enhanced by EDA methodologies and tools related to all application topics of the SMACD24, e.g., AMS, RF and multidomain circuits, and also, emerging devices.</p>

  <h3>IMPORTANT NOTES</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>All accepted submissions in the IC Design Contest will be presented by the students in special sessions and published in the conference proceedings.</li>
    <li>Papers not accepted for the contest short-list will still be considered by the technical program committee for the SMACD 2025 regular sessions.</li>
  </ul>
