    <h2>SMACD Paper Submission Guidelines</h2>
    
    <p>The working language for SMACD is <strong>English</strong>, used for all presentations and printed materials. SMACD will only accept <strong>electronic submissions</strong> in PDF format.</p>

    <h3>Paper Specifications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Paper Length</strong>: Maximum of 4 pages, including figures, tables, and references. Documents exceeding this limit will be <strong>automatically rejected</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Paper Size</strong>: Only US Letter (8.5" x 11") or A4 (210mm x 297mm) formats are accepted.</li>
        <li><strong>Paper Format</strong>: Authors must follow the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank">IEEE double-column conference paper template</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>File Size</strong>: PDF files should not exceed 2.0 MB.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reviewing Process</h3>
    <p><strong>Papers submitted for review must clearly state:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The purpose of the work;</li>
      <li>How and to what extent it advances the state-of-the-art;</li>
      <li>Specific new results and their impact.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The degree to which the paper addresses these criteria will affect the selection process. The most common reason for rejection is the lack of new results. Only work not previously published will be considered.</p>

    <p>Submission of a paper for review and subsequent acceptance implies the authors agree that the work will not be made public before the conference.</p>

    <p><strong>Notification</p></strong>
    <p>After review, authors will be notified of the decision by the <strong>Technical Program Committee</strong> via email.</p>
