<h2>Reviewing Process</h2>
<p>Papers submitted for review must clearly state:</p>
 <ul> 
<li>The purpose of the work;</li>
<li>How and to what extent it advances the state-of-the-art;</li>
<li>Specific new results and their impact.</li>
</ul> 
<p>The degree to which the paper deals with these issues will affect whether the paper is selected. The most frequent cause of rejection of submitted papers is lack of new results. Only work that has not been previously published at the time of the Conference will be considered. Submission of a paper for review and subsequent acceptance is considered by the Committee as an agreement that the work will not be placed in the public domain prior to the Conference. The quality of the conference will be guaranteed by a thoroughly selected Technical Program Committee, which will provide feedback to the authors. </p>
<p>After the paper selection, authors will be informed of the decision of the Technical Program Committee by e-mail on or after April 29th, 2022. At the same time, the preliminary program will be published on the website. </p>
<p>Accepted papers will be published in IEEE Xplore.</p>
