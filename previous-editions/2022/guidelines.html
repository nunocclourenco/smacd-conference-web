	<p>Dear Authors,</p>
        
	<p>	Attendees who are presenting at SMACD 2022 should note the following guidelines.</p>
	<p style="color:red;font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT NOTE: Any accepted paper included in the final program is expected to have at least one author to attend and present the paper at the conference. Authors of the accepted papers included in the final program who do not attend the Conference will be subscribed to a “No Show List”. The “No Show List” will also be made available to the following conferences organizers, who can reject submissions from these authors in the following years, based on their past negative impact on the conference.</p>

		<li><b>Designer interface</b> (e.g., problem setup, result analysis, etc.).</li>
		<li><b>Applicability</b> of the proposal (e.g., general approach or restricted to special problems, circuit classes or sizes, etc.).</li>
		<li><b>Robustness</b> of the design solutions (e.g., against parasitics, variability, etc.) and, of the proposal itself (e.g. convergence, insensitivity to input and starting values, etc.).</li>
		<li><b>Integration</b> degree with commercial design suites and design methodologies (e.g., import and export data from these suites, usability in one or more steps of current design flows, etc.).</li>
