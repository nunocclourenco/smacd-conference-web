			In the 1980's and 1990's, first linear, and then also nonlinear, RF/microwave circuit simulators, triggered a paradigm shift in RF design which also started a pronounced interest for more accurate device models. Nowadays, the pervasive use of digital signal processing techniques, more inventive modeling methods as well more effective optimization algorithms, make us believe that RF design automation can be possible in the near future. This Special Session addresses several recent advancements on both RF/microwave circuit design automation and nonlinear device modeling, providing an up-to-date view of the present state-of-the-art and the near future trends in these exciting technologies.

		The energy and delay benefits achievable via conventional silicon CMOS scaling are diminishing. Therefore, there is an urge to explore new computing strategies and new energy efficient devices and interconnects as the building blocks for energy efficient systems. This special session aims to bring together contributions focusing on different topics related to the modelling and design of circuits and systems using emerging technologies and new computing paradigms, as well as to highlight the latest advances in reliability and fault tolerance techniques for emerging technologies, including FPGA, SoC, MPSoC, three-dimensional technologies (such as 2.5D/3D Integrated Circuits), nanoscale FinFET devices, innovative memories (such as PCRAM, STTMRAM, RRAM), introducing state-of-the-art investigations on the methods and techniques as well as modern implementation technologies enabling an effective and efficient development of highly reliable systems.

Today's computer systems are on the verge of a paradigm shift from general-purpose architectures to cutting-edge specialized technologies optimized for particular computational workloads. This trend is driven by the increased need for autonomous, high-performance systems that can sense and process remotely on a tiny energy budget and footprint. Emerging memory technologies are increasingly growing since they provide novel nanoelectronic devices with outstanding features for single electronic components, including non-volatility, adaptability, low-power operation, and ultra-dense integration. Their operating principles arise from various physical mechanisms, based on their nanoelectronic structure, leading to a wide range of device types, ranging from ionic, and crystallographic (ReRAM, CBRAM, PCM) to magnetic, and ferroelectric devices (MRAM, FTJ, FeFET). Even though the original target of such technologies is memory, they demonstrate suitability for a wide range of novel computing and bio-inspired applications. However, the readiness of these technologies is yet far from large-scale commercialization and they are still facing fundamental issues in modeling, simulation, and circuit design. The main goal of this special session is to bring high-quality research on emerging technologies into SMACD ’23 and to create a forum for fruitful knowledge transfer between the traditional SMACD audience and researchers working on novel computing approaches that utilize emerging devices.

	<p>CMOS technologies and circuit techniques have facilitated the development of innovative physiological sensing devices, ensuring the validity of medical information through analog and digital signal processing methods. Traditional trends in the use of these electronic devices for healthcare are being modified by new habits for healthy lifestyles, paying special attention to prevention and monitoring as key functionalities of the technological solutions. In the last years, a new trend towards extremely low-voltage and ultra-low power circuits is emerging, motivated in part by the interest in implantable or wearable devices for biomedical monitoring, sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and other similar applications. This special session tries to gather novel contributions and challenges related to the use of low-voltage low-power integrated circuits in the field, especially for biomedical applications. </p>
