<p class="intro" >The <b> 2019 edition</b> of the <b>International Conference on Synthesis, Modeling, Analysis
and Simulation Methods and Applications to Circuit Design</b> (SMACD) was held in
Lausanne, Switzerland, as a forum devoted to modeling, simulation and synthesis for
Analog, Mixed-signal, RF (AMS/RF) and multi-domain (MEMs, nanoelectronics,
optoelectronics, biological, etc.) integrated circuits and systems. Experiences with
modeling, simulation and synthesis techniques in diverse application areas are also
welcomed. Objective technologies include CMOS, beyond CMOS, and More-than-
Moore such as MEMs, power devices, sensors, passives, etc. </p>
<p class="intro"> SMACD 2019 was Technically Co-sponsored by IEEE, IEEE CEDA and IEEE CAS. The conference proceedings were included in IEEExplore, and, a selection of papers were considered for
a special issue of <b>Integration, the VLSI Journal</b>, Elsevier.</p>
<p class="intro"> SMACD 2019 was co-located with the 15<sup>th</sup> Conference on PhD Research in Microelectronics and Electronics (PRIME 2019). </p>
