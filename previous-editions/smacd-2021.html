		<p class="intro"> For reasons of safety the 2021 SMACD and PRIME Conferences were organized from July 19<sup>th</sup> until July 22<sup>nd</sup> as an online event. This was not an easy decision.
			However, it gives us greater planning security and the certainty that the conference will take place in any case.
			This way the authors, speakers, exhibitors and all guests will get to keep their trusted platform for exchange and networking on current topics.

<p class="intro"> <span class="base-color">The <b>2021 edition</b> of the <b>International Conference on Synthesis, Modeling, Analysis
and Simulation Methods and Applications to Circuit Design</b></span> (SMACD) was originally planned in Erfurt, Germany,
but was held virtually, as a forum devoted to modeling, simulation and synthesis for Analog,
Mixed-signal, RF (AMS/RF) and multi-domain (nanoelectronics, biological, MEMS, optoelectronics,
etc.) integrated circuits and systems. Experiences with modeling, simulation
and synthesis techniques including machine-learning and artificial intelligence
in diverse application areas are also welcomed. Objective technologies include CMOS,
beyond CMOS, and, More-than-Moore such as MEMS, power devices, sensors, passives,
etc.
